# Customer Personality Analysis

The relationship between businesses and customers is constantly evolving.
In this era, which is entirely driven by technology, there are numerous channels through which customers can be reached. Personalised customer services
aim to cater the exact needs and wants of the customer. Delivering the best
customer experience is critical for businesses to remain profitable, especially in
the highly competitive markets.The knowledge and insights which are gained by
using data mining techniques enable businesses to serve customers according to
their preferences through targeting their actual needs. On top of that, customer
personality analysis helps businesses to modify their product based on their target customers from varied types of customer segments. Models built by using
customer behavior data for future marketing actions can save time and reduce
companyâ€™s marketing expenses.

This analysis is done to better understand customers and offer ideas to modify marketing campaigns and products to the specific needs, behaviours, and
concerns of different types of customers. Moreover, another purpose of this analysis is to learn the behavior of customers who benefited from past campaigns,
and to build various models based on that. This will enable the company to take
actions that will increase the success of future campaigns and reach potential
customers
